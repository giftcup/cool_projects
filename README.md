# cool_projects
This repository contains all things fun, starting from tic-tac-toe to infinity and beyond!
The programs can be run by the command;
python filename.py 
where filename is the name of the program that has to be run.
It also contains programs written in C like The Guessing game
which can be run on the commandline; clang -o filename filename.c
and clicking enter then writing ./filename.
In some compilers, g++ or gcc is used in place of clang.
The projects in this file are unrelated.
